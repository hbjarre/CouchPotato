### Our project file structure (short description/purpose of each file)

- **favicon.ico**
    #An image of a potato, which is our logo. The purpose is that favicon is used as the logo that is shown as image icon, where the title text in the header is shown.

- **film-roll.png**
    #An image of a filmroll that is shown when no picture was found from the API call(though it doesnâ€™t work at the moment).

- **soffpotatis.png**
    #An image of our potato logo and the purpose is to show this in the header and more.
   
- **index.html**
    #This our html file that contains our root tag which we later fill with tags from our js files.

- **Fire.js**
    #Connection to firebase. This file contains our setup with our firebase project. The purpose of this file is that in all our js files where we need to have a connection with firebase we can import this file instead of repeating code.

- **apikey.js**

- **GalleryModel.js**
	#Here we have all our functions that make api calls and changes to our database in firebase.

- **ObservableModel.js**
	#Here we have our observer functions. Our GalleryModel is later extended with this file. We never notify our observers so this file may be completely useless? If you have any comments about whether we should use this or not, please tell us :)
