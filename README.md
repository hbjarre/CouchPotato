# CouchPotato
**A website for movies and series. In the app you can add a watchlist and more!**
>You can see a demo of our website [here](https://couchpotato-ca085.firebaseapp.com/).

## Short description of our project
With our website you can look up information about different movies and series! Features include:
* Search around for titles of movies
* Discovery mode, where you can click on different genres to discover popular movies in that genre
* Wish list, where you can add movies or series(by clicking :star:) that you want to watch later

The app uses React as framework and :fire:[firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for our backend. The API that we've used is [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/).

### To start and try the app

> - Go to the projects [website](https://couchpotato-ca085.firebaseapp.com/) or run the code on your computer.
> - Start by creating a user by clicking "signup". You can use a fake email adress if you want.
> - From here on you can use this user whenever you are logged out or from any computer you want.

## What we have done
* Model connected to the OMDb API
* Login with Firebase
* Header with a searchbar and menu
* Start page with popular movies
* Search function with a filter for showing movies
* Detail view for individual movies
* Wish list function that saves a users wish list in a Firebase database



## Our project file structure (short description/purpose of each file)
